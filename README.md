# Data_Analysis_Project:

## Mini-Project Overview
This project involves analyzing a dataset of your choice to explore interesting questions, conduct data analysis, and apply predictive or clustering models. The work is divided into five main parts:

## Dataset Selection:

Chose a dataset from the provided options (e.g., Adult Income, US Estimated Crimes, Diabetes Prediction).
Described the dataset, including its features, types, and number of records.
## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Conducted an initial exploration of the dataset to understand variable distributions and relationships.
Visualized distributions for at least five variables and examined bivariate relationships for two variable pairs.
Estimation and Hypothesis Testing:

Defined a research question and formulated null and alternative hypotheses.
Performed hypothesis testing and reported the results.

## Classification: 
Used k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) to classify data, detailing the target variable and predictive features.

Summarized the project in a comprehensive report, covering questions, dataset details, analysis, findings, limitations, and future directions.
Addressed dataset limitations and proposed further questions and additional data for future research.

This project demonstrates the application of data analysis techniques, hypothesis testing, and predictive modeling to extract meaningful insights from real-world datasets.
